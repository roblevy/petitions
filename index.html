    When you first get here, the two petitions are started off at zero. The <em>changes</em> to the petition signatory count are then tracked once every two seconds or so. The total number of signatories is shown by the numbers above the chart. The chart goes between 0 and 500. This is just a quick, dirty way to use the fact that parliament.uk publishes data on its polls, a fact I find very cool indeed. But there's clearly a lot of room for improvement. If you want to make it better go to <a href="github.com/roblevy/petitions/">my Github</a> and sort it out.
